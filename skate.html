    <h3>Inline Freestyle Skating Coaching</h3>
  </header>

  <section class="intro">
    <p>Even though Inline Freestyle Skating is not yet part of major competitions like the SEA Games or the Olympics, it presents its own unique challenges. Like any sport, it demands strength and conditioning, but it also requires mastery of technical skills for every move.<br><br>
    At the highest competitive level, Speed Slalom demands the explosive power and acceleration of a 100m sprinter. Classic Slalom routines are judged with the same precision and artistic scrutiny as figure skating performances. Slides test an athlete’s courage, control, and flexibility to the limit.<br><br>
    To me, Inline Freestyle Skating feels like a combination of multiple sports rolled into one. It’s dynamic, endlessly challenging, and you’ll never get bored of it.</p>
